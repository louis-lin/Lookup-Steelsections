#### LookupShapes
Opens a tkinter application that allows user to input any shape they want and list their properties.

Considerations:
* The output is copy-and-pastable; Output is tab seperated
* Additional shape properties can be added as need be by altering the dictionary for retrieval
* The AISC excel sheet is necessary and the correct path should be hard coded
